## My site!

I decided that it was about time to make my site more professional and actually tell some about me.  
For this project I wanted to select a stack that would be quick to pickup and address my need efficiently - Astro was a no brainer
- It has exactly as much SSR as I need  
- I can keep my blog (and really the rest of my site) as static as possible  
- Efficient resource management (ship-size)  
- Easy to learn
- Can add and remove libraries as needed  
This was my first time using tailwind - even if it doesn't look the best, the animations and styling was at least fun and intuitive to learn.
## My stack
Astro.js  
React.js  
Tailwindcss  
Deployed with Netlify

While this site was fully coded and stylesd by me, the design was very much drawn from  
Sean Haplins March 2023 design https://www.seanhalpin.xyz  
and I followed devaslife to setup this project, so a lot of the config is pulled from <a href='https://www.craftz.dog/' target='_blank'>Takuya Matsuyama's website</a>
